Many-To-Many relationships in SQL require a "Join Table"

The join table will bridge together foreign keys and their primary key references

This allows you to associate and dissasociate cats and toys from eachother, without deleting a cat or toy to do so


In Django, most of the heavy lifting in many-to-many relationships are handled by Django itself!

Forms and templates aside, all you need to do to implement a many-to-many relationship using Django is:

1. Add a ManyToManyField on one of the Models
2. Create the migration and migrate it to update the database

Django willcreate a “hidden” join table for you!

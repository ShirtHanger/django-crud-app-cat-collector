Create a new repository on GitHub named django-crud-app-cat-collector.

---
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/django-crud-app-cat-collector.git
---

Next, cd into your new cloned directory, django-crud-app-cat-collector:

---
cd django-crud-app-cat-collector
---

Initialize a new virtual environment inside your project directory and install Django:

---
pipenv install django
---

This command will create a new Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in your project directory, specifying Django as a dependency.

Activate the virtual environment:

---
pipenv shell
---

With your virtual environment activated you should see a slight change in your terminal, 
with the virtual environment folder name listed to the left of your command line prompt.

Start a new Django project within your virtual environment:

---
django-admin startproject catcollector .
---

The . here starts this project inside of our current directory, instead of creating a new one.

To deactivate the virtual environment when youâ€™re done, simply type:

---
exit
---

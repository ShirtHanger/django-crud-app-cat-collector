Class based views allow you to better organize views.py by passing in models and re-use code

Types of class-based views

ListView - Index page of all instances of a model
DetailView - used to implement the “detail” page for an instance of a Model
CreateView - Create an instance of a Model
DeleteView - Delete an instance of a Model
UpdateView - Update an instance of a Model

CLASS BASED VIEWS IMPLEMENT CRUD FORMS AUTOMATICALLY!!!

EASY!

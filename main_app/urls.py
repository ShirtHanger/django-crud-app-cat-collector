""" 
The above code defines a root path using an empty string and maps it to the view.home 
view function that does not exist yet - making the server unhappy. 
Weâ€™ll remedy this with a new view in the next step.

The name='home' kwarg is technically optional but will come in 
handy for referencing the URL 
in other parts of the app, especially from 
within templates, so we will always use it.

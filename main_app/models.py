#More model field types

""" 

These field types are important for several reasons:

Validation: Django uses the field types to apply automatic data validation in forms, 
ensuring that data conforms to the expected format before itâ€™s processed or stored.

Form Rendering: The field type also determines the default HTML widget used in forms.

Much easier form creation than react!
